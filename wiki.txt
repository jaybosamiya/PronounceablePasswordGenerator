The player controls a Sea Harrier fighter, looking sideways onto a right-to-left scrolling seascape and landscape. The aim of the game is to take off from a carrier, attack ships and land targets, avoid the odd missile and enemy fighter, then land back on the carrier again. Although the game was a work of fiction, it was inspired by the 1982 Falklands War, in which the Sea Harrier had played a major role.
One interesting little quirk to the game was that, it was possible to bomb your own ship as you took off from it. If you did this, when you returned it would no longer be there (having sunk, presumably) and being unable to land on it your plane would just continue flying until it ran out of fuel and crashed.
Durell managed to get the executable size down to just under 9 kilobytes, which allowed for a fast loading time from cassette. The game sold over 250,000 copies in total.

TSMV Manunda was an Australian registered and crewed passenger ship which was converted to a hospital ship in 1940. During the war Manunda saw service in both the Middle East and Pacific Campaigns, specifically New Guinea. She resumed her passenger duties after the war, before being sold to a Japanese company and finally broken up in 1957.

Early history[edit source | editbeta]

In 1927 the Adelaide Steamship Company in Australia ordered a new 9,119 GRT liner to provide full-time Australian coastal passenger services, which had previously only been offered by the company on a limited scale.
The Twin Screw Motor Vessel Manunda was built by William Beardmore and Company at Dalmuir in Scotland and was launched on 27 November 1928. Completed on 16 April 1929, she arrived in Australia in June 1929 to begin her duties on the Australian Coastal Trade, running passengers and cargo between Sydney, Fremantle, Melbourne and Cairns.
She accommodated 176 first class and 136 second class passengers and sailed at a service speed of 15 knots. She was the largest ship operated by the Adelaide Steamship Company, and as a result of her success the company commissioned a larger, faster sister ship, the Manoora, which was completed in 1935.[2]
Manunda in World War II[edit source | editbeta]



The newly fitted hospital ship Manunda in Sydney Harbour on 17 August 1940
The declaration of war saw Manunda fitted out as DEMS ship (Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship), under the control of the Australian Shipping Control Board.
She was converted into a hospital ship at Sydney in compliance with the Geneva Convention Regulations and was taken over by the authorities on 25 May 1940, and entered service as AHS Manunda on 22 July 1940, under Captain James Garden, previously the captain of the Adelaide Steamship Company Manoora and Commodore of the Adelaide Steamship Fleet. The general hospital based on board was commanded by Lt. Col. John Beith, and members of the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS) on board were led by Matron Clara Jane Shumack (1899-1974).
Manunda sailed on a shakedown cruise to Darwin, Port Moresby and returned to Sydney, before heading for Suez in the Middle East (she made four trips to the Middle East and Mediterranean between November 1940 and September 1941). She was then despatched to Darwin.
On the morning of 19 February 1942, Manunda was damaged during the Japanese air raids on Darwin, despite her highly prominent red cross markings on a white background. 13 members of the ships’ crew and hospital staff were killed, 19 others were seriously wounded and another 40 or so received minor wounds. The Manunda was able to act as a casualty clearing station for injured personnel from other ships involved in the attack. She sailed to Fremantle the next day.
Captain James Garden was later awarded the OBE, in 1945,[3] for his bravery and skill, both during the attacks, in leading a fire extinguishing team on the ship and in later navigating it by the stars to Fremantle with no navigation equipment and a jury-rigged steering system.
After a refit in Adelaide, she went to Milne Bay in Papua New Guinea, where she acted as a floating hospital for the Allied forces who were stationed there. She spent several nights in Milne Bay, during attacks by Japanese warships, but her status as a hospital ship was, on this occasion honored by Japanese naval units, which raked her with searchlights on three nights running.
She made a total of 27 voyages from Milne Bay to Brisbane and Sydney transporting wounded troops. As the war continued, she was relocated as required and she followed the Allied forces the various islands around the Pacific. Manunda's final wartime voyage was to New Zealand transporting civilian passengers. During the war she carried approximately 30,000 casualties to safety.
After the Japanese surrendered Manunda was despatched in September 1945 to Singapore to repatriate ex-POWs and civilian internees who had been imprisoned in Changi Prison. She also sailed to Labuan in Borneo to pick up ex-POWs and civilian internees from Batu Lintang camp.
Post war career[edit source | editbeta]

Manunda was decommissioned in September 1946 and received an extensive 18-month refit in Melbourne. She returned to service on 2 April 1948, transporting passengers around the Australian coast. In September 1956 she was withdrawn from service and placed on the market. She sold very quickly and was purchased by Okadagumi Shipping Ltd. of Japan. She sailed from Sydney for the last time as TSMV Hakone Maru on 4 October, 1956.
The company’s plans for her did not eventuate, and she was broken up the next year in Japan, arriving in Osaka for scrapping on 18 June 1957.

Gibraltar Health Authority
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The Gibraltar Health Authority (GHA) is the national publicly funded healthcare organisation of the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. The authority comes under the responsibility of the Government of Gibraltar. As of 2012 the authority was responsible for the health of some 27,000 individuals. The GHA and Social Welfare System are closely based upon their British counterparts, namely the National Health Service.[1] As of 2003 the organisation was funded through roughly £19 million ($27 million) of social insurance stamp contributions through the Gibraltar Group Practice Medical Scheme.[2]

Biography[edit source]

Early Life and Career Beginnings[edit source]
Cherlise was born one of ten children. Born and raised in the Carol City section of Miami, Cherlise developed her interest in music at a very early age. She began writing at the age of 13. This soprano couldn't deny the strong connection she had with music. After deciding to pursue it as a career, she would clean the local studios for free recording time. "...That's how I put together my demo..." says Cherlise. She was discovered by her current manager, Percy Forrest, on the video set for rapper Fat Joe. Cherlise was introduced to songwriter/producer Rico Love. Love and Cherlise worked over the next two years, and when Love closed his deal with Universal Motown for his Division1 imprint, he quickly signed Cherlise.[4]
2011-Present: Like A Woman and Mixtape Groundzero[edit source]
Cherlise released her first official single Love U Right to radios in July 2011. The song featured rapper Lil Wayne.[5] Love U Right was then released to iTunes 13 September 2011.[6] The single was the first single from her up and coming mixtape "Ground Zero" to be released in December before her album. The second official single is "Hollyhood" ft. Brianna.[7]
In an interview, Fat Joe said about Cherlise, “We got a female R&B singer that me and Rico Love, the writer, both work with. her name is Cherlise out of Miami. She’s phenomenal! her album is coming out this year or next year.”[8] On November 26 it was announced that Cherlise's first album would be called "Like A Woman" and also announced that the album would be due sometime in 2012.[9] Cherlise was interviewed in late August 2011 on her new album and her sound "My music is very dance-driven and very sassy and definitely has a sexual tone to it, but it definitely is just fresh. If I just have to say it in words, it’s just a fresh sound and fresh feel." She also said "I don’t have an album name yet because I’m holding off on the final product. We’ve been working almost three years on the album. You should definitely expect a classic album. As far as features, we have Jim Jonsin and we have Earl and E. There’s a long list of people that we’ve been working with. As far as features are concerned, we have Lil’ Wayne right now. I don’t want to go crazy with the features because it is my debut album so I’m really looking forward to the world getting a chance to know me as an artist and just fall in love with my music."[10] In an interview cherlise said "I’m working on my album right now. I’ve been in the lab with Lil Wayne, Fat Joe, Maino, Young Chris, and a few other artists. You should look forward to big things! My main focus however, is my album. It’s going to be a classic!"[11]
Artistry[edit source]

(1974)
Squeeze is the fifth and final studio album released under the Velvet Underground name. While labeled as a Velvet Underground record, it actually features none of the original members, having been written and recorded almost entirely by multi-instrumentalist Doug Yule. Yule had joined the Velvet Underground prior to recording their self-titled third album, replacing founding member John Cale, and had contributed significantly to the fourth album, Loaded. Following the departures of the remaining founding members, Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison, Yule took control of the band. Longtime drummer Maureen Tucker was slated to appear on Squeeze by Yule, but she was dismissed by the band's manager, Steve Sesnick.
Following a promotional tour for the album by Yule and a backing band, Yule called it quits, bringing the Velvet Underground to an end. Squeeze failed to chart and quickly fell into obscurity after its release. Critics generally dismiss the record "a Velvet Underground album in name only".

Composition and recording[edit source | editbeta]

In 1971, the Velvet Underground consisted of Doug Yule (vocals, guitar), Willie Alexander (keyboards, vocals), Walter Powers (bass guitar) and Maureen Tucker (drums). This version of the band had toured the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in October and November 1971 to support its latest album, Loaded, which had been written and recorded when Lou Reed was in the band, and which had seen a European release in March 1971. The plan was to record a second and final album for their record company, Atlantic Records, afterwards,[1] but Atlantic lost faith and decided to issue an archive recording from 1970 featuring Lou Reed, Live at Max's Kansas City, instead.
After the tour, band manager Steve Sesnick managed to get a recording deal with Polydor UK to record a final Velvet Underground album. Alexander, Powers and Tucker were sent back to the United States by Sesnick, however, presumably for him to retain maximum control over the finished product. Thus, although Squeeze was released nominally as a Velvet Underground album, Yule was the only Velvet to actually perform on it. Yule later said, "I don’t think Moe [Tucker] would have been expensive in money, but too costly in terms of 'management', meaning that she didn’t take a lot of bullshit and would have taken a lot of 'handling' on Sesnick's part."[2] Yule also recalled that the album "was done with just me. All the basic tracks were laid down with drums and me. Ian Paice of Deep Purple played the drums. So he and I would lay down a track. How much interplay can you have when all it is is one guitar or a piano? You can hear that, it's kind of dead. I think you get more when you have 3 or 4 people playing together, they feed off each other, they work together and something comes out of it, it's bigger."[3]
The eleven songs that make up Squeeze were written by Yule and recorded with the help of Ian Paice, with additional occasional saxophone and backing singer assistance. They range from Beatles-like whimsy ("Crash") via pop to typical 1970s rock ("Mean Old Man"). Yule later recalled, "I remember sitting on a plane writing extensive notes on the mixing of the album. I sent it to Steve and none of my suggestions were taken, I'm sure he didn't even read it. He mixed it for the best possible commercial success. (...) It's really embarrassing. I gave what I had at the time. There are parts of it I hate and parts I don't. But if I had to do it over again, it would be a completely different album, with different people and have nothing to do with Sesnick."[2]
Release and reception[edit source | editbeta]

Squeeze was recorded in the autumn of 1972 and released in the United Kingdom, France, Germany (all 1973), Spain (1974), and Japan (year unknown).[7] No singles were taken off it and the album did not chart. Yule assembled a backing band consisting of Rob Norris (guitar), George Kay (bass guitar) and Mark Nauseef (drums) to tour the United Kingdom in November and December 1972 to promote the upcoming album; a live recording from this tour is included on the 2001 live box set Final V.U. 1971-1973. After the tour, during which they were deserted by Sesnick, Yule also called it quits, bringing the Velvet Underground to an end.[8]
Squeeze saw a number of re-issues in France during the 1970s and early 1980s.[7] It was out of print since, until it received a compact disc and new LP release in 2012 by Kismet Records (see below). The status of Squeeze in the Velvet Underground's recorded canon is generally regarded as dubious. In the early 1970s, the NME Book of Rock counted it as "a Velvet Underground album in name only".[9][page needed] The 1995 CD boxed set Peel Slowly and See includes the four studio albums from the Lou Reed era of the band, but excludes Squeeze; in the liner notes, David Fricke dismisses it as "an embarrassment to the VU discography." Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine says "it doesn’t just ride the coattails of VU’s legacy but deliberately co-opts their achievement -- but it’s listenable, something its reputation never suggests".[4] In March 2012, Classic Rock included the album at 28 in their list of The 50 Worst Albums of All Time.[10]
In 1995, Yule described the recording of Squeeze being "like the blind leading the blind, me leading myself. That's what came out of it, I don't even have a copy of it. But it's kind of a nice memory for me and kind of an embarrassment at the same time. I wish I had my eyes wider open, but it was nice to get my name and my songs out there."[3]
CD release[edit source | editbeta]

In 2012, Squeeze received both a CD release and a new LP release from Kismet,[11] a label that specializes in reissuing obscure albums by relatively unknown acts. On the CD, a slight amount of white noise can be heard throughout, indicating that it was recorded directly from an LP copy of the album. The reissues do not appear to be officially licensed from Polydor, the label the original album was on. A disclaimer included with the release states: "Due to the obscurity of releases on this label, we are occasionally unable to locate the owner of the master recordings. As we have no desire to deprive owners of their royalties, we have created an escrow account in the hopes that the rightful owners will see these releases and contact us. This approach is far from desirable but this is the only way we can bring this music to a wider audience." An e-mail address is then provided for the owner(s) of the music to contact Kismet for payment of royalties.[12]
The reissues contain no outtakes. The packages do feature a short article from Melody Maker written by Richard Williams, originally published on October 6, 1971. The article features brief comments from Yule about the then-current UK tour that he was completing with original Velvet drummer Mo Tucker and recently added members Walter Powers and William Alexander.

The California bearing ratio (CBR) is a penetration test for evaluation of the mechanical strength of road subgrades and basecourses. It was developed by the California Department of Transportation before World War II.
The test is performed by measuring the pressure required to penetrate a soil sample with a plunger of standard area. The measured pressure is then divided by the pressure required to achieve an equal penetration on a standard crushed rock material. The CBR test is described in ASTM Standards D1883-05 (for laboratory-prepared samples) and D4429 (for soils in place in field), and AASHTO T193. The CBR test is fully described in BS 1377 : Soils for civil engineering purposes : Part 4, Compaction related tests.
The CBR rating was developed for measuring the load-bearing capacity of soils used for building roads. The CBR can also be used for measuring the load-bearing capacity of unimproved airstrips or for soils under paved airstrips. The harder the surface, the higher the CBR rating. A CBR of 3 equates to tilled farmland, a CBR of 4.75 equates to turf or moist clay, while moist sand may have a CBR of 10. High quality crushed rock has a CBR over 80. The standard material for this test is crushed California limestone which has a value of 100.
CBR=\frac {p}{p_s} \cdot 100 \quad 
CBR \quad	= CBR [%]
p \quad	= measured pressure for site soils [N/mm²]
p_s \quad	= pressure to achieve equal penetration on standard soil [N/mm²]

Michael Lee Capel (born October 13, 1961) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed pitcher who played for the Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers, and Houston Astros. In 49 career games, Capel pitched 62.1 innings, struck out 43 batters, and had a career win–loss record of 3–4 with a 4.62 earned run average (ERA). While he played in MLB, Capel stood at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). A starting pitcher in college and parts of his minor league baseball career, he converted to relief pitching while in Chicago's minor league system.
The Philadelphia Phillies chose Capel in the 24th round of the 1980 MLB Draft, but instead of signing a professional contract, he opted to attend the University of Texas. Capel played on the 1982 USA College All-Star Team, which competed in the Amateur World Series in Seoul and placed third. The next year, Capel and the Texas Longhorns won the College World Series. After he was drafted by the Cubs, Capel left Texas and signed to play professional baseball. He spent six seasons playing minor league baseball before making his MLB debut in 1988. Capel played the entire 1989 season in Triple-A, one level below the majors, but the Cubs released him at the end of the year. He agreed to terms with the Brewers and played in MLB after an injury opened a spot on Milwaukee's roster, but was again released at the end of the season. The Astros then signed Capel; he played in 25 games for Houston, the most of any MLB team Capel played for. He spent the final part of his career in the Astros farm system, and after making the 1992 Triple-A All-Star team, played his last season in 1993. After retirement, Capel worked as the general manager of a car dealership in Houston, Texas.

Early life[edit source]

Capel was born on October 13, 1961, in Marshall, Texas, and attended Spring High School in Harris County.[1] As a child, he enjoyed watching the Astros play on weekends.[2] During his senior year in 1979, the Spring Lions won the AAAA conference state championship, and Capel was named to the All-State team, composed of the best high school players in the state.[3][4] He set several pitching records at Spring High School.[5] Future teammate Calvin Schiraldi called Capel a "hard thrower when he came out of high school" and "the top guy out of the state in 1980";[6] Roger Clemens said he was "probably the best pitcher in the state at that time".[5] The Philadelphia Phillies drafted Capel with the 605th overall pick in the 1980 MLB Draft, but instead of signing with the Phillies, he chose to attend the University of Texas.[7][8]
Collegiate career[edit source]

Capel enrolled at the University of Texas in 1981, but did not play baseball, as stretched ligaments in his elbow forced him to miss his freshman season. Capel pitched sidearmed for the remainder of his collegiate career to compensate for a loss in the velocity of his fastball.[6] In 1982, he was named to the All-Southwest Conference team and pitched to a 9–0 win–loss record with a 3.68 ERA, as the Longhorns finished 59–6.[9][10] His 1982 winning percentage of 1.000 ties him with 10 others for the best single-season winning percentage in Longhorns history (with a minimum of nine decisions).[11] At the 1982 College World Series, Texas defeated the Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Stanford Cardinal, but losses to the Miami Hurricanes and the Wichita State Shockers eliminated them from play per the tournament's double-elimination format.[12] Capel played on the United States team in the 1982 Amateur World Series overseen by the International Baseball Federation. Starting against Australia, he pitched a 14–4 complete game victory, as the match ended after seven innings per the championship's ten run rule.[13] The United States eventually placed third in the competition.[14][15]
The 1983 Longhorns finished with a 61–14 record and were ranked as the number one team in the nation by Collegiate Baseball Magazine.[16] That season, the Texas team featured four future MLB pitchers: Capel, Clemens, Bruce Ruffin, and Schiraldi.[17] In the 1983 College World Series, Capel allowed four hits in a complete game against the Michigan Wolverines as the Longhorns advanced to the World Series finals.[18] Facing the Alabama Crimson Tide, the Longhorns made Clemens their starting pitcher and won 4–3.[17] The championship was the fourth World Series title in University of Texas history, and their first since 1975.[19] Capel finished the season with a 13–1 record and a 2.98 ERA.[10] His career winning percentage (.957) ties him with Rick Burley for the fifth-best in Texas Longhorns history.[11] In June, before the College World Series, he was drafted by the Cubs with the 320th overall pick in the 1983 MLB Draft.[20]
Professional career[edit source]

Chicago Cubs[edit source]
After he signed a professional contract with the Cubs, Capel no longer threw sidearmed.[6] Capel began professional baseball with the Class A Quad Cities Cubs, but was promoted to the Double-A Midland Cubs shortly into the season. Over 11 games, he finished with a 4–3 record and a 3.51 ERA.[21] In 1984, Capel split playing time between the Class A-Advanced Lodi Crushers and Midland; he led Midland in losses (10) and wild pitches (11) and had the second-worst ERA (6.31) on the team.[22] With Midland, Capel started 11 games out of the 16 that he appeared in.[21] On his 0–7 record for the Crushers, Tom Alexander of the Lodi News-Sentinel wrote that Capel's luck "has been all bad when it comes to wins".[23] Both Lodi and Midland finished their seasons with losing records.[22][24]
From 1985–86, he played for the Double-A Pittsfield Cubs of the Eastern League. In 1986, Capel only pitched in relief, had a career-best 1.87 ERA over 62.2 innings pitched, and led his team with 13 saves.[25] After he was promoted to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs, Capel split time between starting and relieving roles in 1987.[6] At 7–10, Capel tied for Iowa's lead in wins and losses, and led the team in strikeouts, with 75; his 7 wins became a career high, and his loss total matched a career high set in Midland three years earlier.[21] After the season, Ray Sons of the Chicago Sun-Times said Capel "may be ready for middle relief in Chicago", and Dave van Dyck listed him as a prospect for the 1988 season.[26][27][28] During winter, Capel, Greg Maddux, Manny Trillo, Damon Berryhill, and several other Cubs played for teams in the Caribbean. Capel played for the Águilas del Zulia of Venezuela and led the team with five saves.[29][30]
"Honestly, it doesn't feel that good. I didn't deserve the win. If I would have done my job, it would have been Al [Nipper]'s win. I never dreamed my first win would be like that."
Capel on his first career MLB win[31]
Capel played in spring training ball as he tried to make Chicago's opening day roster.[6] After the Cubs acquired Mike Bielecki from the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 31, 1988, they assigned Capel to Triple-A despite a Sun-Times prediction that he would be on the MLB roster.[32][33] Prior to the acquisition, when Al Nipper was supposed to become the Cubs' fifth starter, Capel was to take his spot in the bullpen.[32] The Cubs recalled Capel and Mark Grace to the majors on May 3, while Drew Hall and Rolando Roomes were optioned to Iowa; at the time, he had a 1.54 ERA and two saves in Triple-A ball.[34] On May 7, Capel made his MLB debut: he pitched the final 1.2 innings of a game against the San Francisco Giants, allowing no runs and no hits but issuing a walk in a 2–1 Cubs loss.[35] His first career win came the following day against the Giants, although he blew a save by giving up a two-run home run to Bob Brenly and lost a 5–4 lead. The Cubs ultimately won 13–7.[36] Capel continued to pitch for the club until June 30, when the Cubs optioned him to Iowa to open a roster spot for Rich "Goose" Gossage to come off the 15-day disabled list (DL).[37]
He returned to the MLB club on August 8 to replace Schiraldi, but was demoted on August 13 before making an appearance, as Chicago activated Les Lancaster from the DL.[38][39] Capel rejoined the club on August 31, and pitched in five more games before the season's end.[40][41] Over his first MLB season, Capel pitched in 20 games and allowed 16 earned runs over 29.1 innings for a 4.91 ERA.[1] He pitched the entire 1989 season for Iowa, appearing in 64 games for the team.[21] On October 15, Capel was granted free agency by the Cubs; he signed with the Brewers two months later.[1]
Milwaukee Brewers[edit source]
Capel competed against 22 other pitchers for an MLB roster spot in the Brewers' spring training camp.[42] The Brewers optioned Capel to their Triple-A affiliate, the Denver Zephyrs, on April 5, before the start of Milwaukee's 1990 season.[43] On May 17, Denver placed Capel on the DL with a strained Achilles tendon, which opened a roster spot on the Zephyrs and allowed the Brewers to send Jaime Navarro back to Denver.[44] When the Brewers needed a replacement for the injured Bill Wegman, Capel was called up to the major leagues.[45] For his Brewers debut, Capel faced five batters and allowed four runs (two charged to Capel) against the Baltimore Orioles.[46] His strikeout of Billy Ripken was the only MLB out Capel recorded in 1990. On June 8, he made his second and final outing with the Brewers and allowed four runs (three charged to Capel) against the Toronto Blue Jays; combined, batters hit .857 against Capel as he finished the season with a 135.00 ERA.[47][48] When Greg Vaughn, returning from a turf toe injury and a sprained left ankle, was activated from the DL on June 11, Capel was sent to Triple-A.[49] He finished the season with Denver where he had a 4–3 record with a 4.26 ERA.[21] On October 4, the Brewers granted Capel free agency; he signed with the Astros on January 5, 1991.[21]
Houston Astros[edit source]
"All I want is another chance. I'm not a flashy pitcher. I'm not outstanding. But I have knowledge for the game and I respond to pressure situations. Too often teams look at a pitcher's velocity, his size and what round he was taken when they consider signing him. They don't look at you as a person. I'm looking for that chance to meet someone who would recognize me as a pitcher who has the right makeup. I believe I can be an asset to any club."
Capel on his 1992 season[2]
Capel began his 1991 season with the Triple-A Tucson Toros; the Astros added Capel to their MLB roster on June 7. Two days later, against the New York Mets, Capel allowed the game-winning home run to Howard Johnson in the top of the 11th inning.[50] Against the Mets on June 14, Capel, starting pitcher Pete Harnisch, and closer Jim Clancy combined for a four-hitter.[51] His final MLB appearance came on August 14 against the San Diego Padres, when he pitched one inning in relief of Jim Corsi in a 4–1 loss.[52] Capel said that pitching for Houston was "the high point of my career".[2] Over 25 games pitched, Capel finished the season with a 1–3 record and a 3.03 ERA.[1]
To reduce their roster to 35 players, the Astros assigned Capel and seven others to the Toros prior to the 1992 MLB season.[2][53] Capel was selected to the Triple-A All-Star Game to replace Tim Scott, whom the Padres promoted to MLB. He told Javier Morales of the Arizona Daily Star that "this is one of the greatest thrills of my career", and he hoped it showed the Astros that he could pitch in MLB.[2] Doug Jones worked as Houston's closer in 1992, however, and Capel never played for the MLB club.[54] For the Toros, Capel had a 6–6 record and a 2.19 ERA with a team-leading 18 saves.[55] The following season, the Montreal Expos invited Capel to their spring camp as a non-roster invitee.[56] Capel elected to remain with the Astros organization where he allowed 26 earned runs in 32.2 innings and pitched the entire season in Triple-A.[57] The Toros, managed by Rick Sweet, finished first in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) South Division with a 83–60 record and made the playoffs.[58][59] Unlike the 1993 MLB playoffs, in which four teams competed, only two teams could make the PCL playoffs. In the championship series, the Toros faced the Portland Beavers, champions of the North Division and holders of a PCL-best 87–56 record.[60] In a best-of-seven series, the Toros defeated the Beavers four games to two.[59] After the season, the Astros did not re-sign Capel.[1] While playing in MLB, Capel stood at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg).[1]
Personal life[edit source]

In February 1986, Capel pitched in the University of Texas Alumni v. Varsity game, which ended in a 14–14 tie.[61] Capel started using dipping tobacco in 1976 and in March 1988 had a non-cancerous lesion removed from his lip; as of March 1988, he was trying to quit the product.[62][63] Capel met his wife, Elizabeth, at Roger Clemens' wedding.[2] Outside of baseball, he is a close friend of Clemens, and during Clemens' 2012 perjury trial, Capel testified on his work ethic and character.[64][65] In 2012, Capel worked as the general manager of a car dealership in Houston.[66]

The Peasants' Revolt, also called Wat Tyler's Rebellion or the Great Rising, was a major uprising across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years War, and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in Essex on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in the town of Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, an end to the system of unfree labour known as serfdom and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.
Inspired by the sermons of the radical cleric John Ball, and led by Wat Tyler, a contingent of Kentish rebels advanced on London. They were met at Blackheath by representatives of the royal government, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade them to return home. King Richard II, then aged only 14, retreated to the safety of the Tower of London, but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England. On 13 June, the rebels entered London and, joined by many local townsfolk, attacked the gaols, destroyed the Savoy Palace and the Temple Inns of Court, set fire to law books and killed anyone associated with the royal government. The following day, Richard met the rebels at Mile End and acceded to most of their demands, including the abolition of serfdom. Meanwhile, rebels entered the Tower of London, killing the Lord Chancellor and the Lord High Treasurer, whom they found inside.
On 15 June Richard left the city to meet with Tyler and the rebels at Smithfield. Violence broke out, and Richard's party killed Tyler. Richard defused the tense situation long enough for London's mayor, William Walworth, to gather a militia from the city and disperse the rebel forces. Richard immediately began to re-establish order in London and rescinded his previous grants to the rebels. The revolt had also spread into East Anglia, where the University of Cambridge was attacked and many royal officials were killed. Unrest continued until the intervention of Henry le Despenser, who defeated a rebel army at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June. Troubles extended north to the cities of York, Beverley and Scarborough, and west as far as Bridgwater in Somerset. Richard mobilised around 4,000 soldiers to help restore order. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed; by November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed.
The Peasants' Revolt has been widely studied by academics. Late 19th-century historians used a range of sources from contemporary chroniclers to assemble an account of the uprising, and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives. Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years. Once seen as a defining moment in English history, modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history. The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years War, by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France. The revolt has been widely used in socialist literature, including by the author William Morris, and remains a potent political symbol for the political left, informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s.

Main article: Consequences of the Black Death
The Peasants' Revolt was fed by the economic and social upheaval of the 14th century.[1] At the start of the century, the majority of English people worked in the countryside, as part of a sophisticated economy that fed the country's towns and cities and supported an extensive international trade.[2] Across much of England, production was organised around manors, controlled by local lords – including the gentry and the Church – and governed through a system of manorial courts.[3] Some of the population were unfree serfs, who had to work on their lords' lands for a period of time each year, although the balance of free and unfree varied across England, and in the south-east there were relatively few serfs.[4] Some serfs were born unfree and could not leave their manors to work elsewhere without the consent of the local lord; others accepted limitations on their freedom as part of the tenure agreement for their farmland.[5] Population growth led to pressure on the available agricultural land, increasing the power of local landowners.[6]
In 1348 a plague known as the Black Death crossed from Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population.[7] After an initial period of economic shock, England began to adapt to the changed economic situation.[8] The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply.[9] Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards.[10] In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded.[11] The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.[12]
The authorities responded to the chaos with emergency legislation, the Ordinance of Labourers, passed in 1349, and the Statute of Labourers of 1351.[13] These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making it a crime to refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed.[14] The system was initially enforced through special Justices of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal Justices of the Peace, typically members of the local gentry.[15] Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking additional wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion.[16] The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include branding and imprisonment.[17] The royal government had not intervened in this way before, or allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.[18]
Over the next few decades, economic opportunities increased for the English peasantry.[19] Some labourers took up specialist jobs that would have previously been barred to them, and others moved from employer to employer, or became servants in richer households.[20] These changes were keenly felt across the south-east of England, where the London market created a wide range of opportunities for farmers and artisans.[21] Local lords had the right to prevent serfs from leaving their manors, but when serfs found themselves blocked in the manorial courts, many simply left to work illegally on manors elsewhere.[22] Wages continued to rise, and between the 1340s and the 1380s the purchasing power of rural labourers increased by around 40 percent.[23] As the wealth of the lower classes increased, Parliament brought in fresh laws in 1363 to prevent them from consuming expensive goods formerly only affordable by the elite. These sumptuary laws proved unenforceable, but the wider labour laws continued to be firmly applied.[24]
War and finance[edit source | edit]
Another factor in the revolt of 1381 was the management of the war with France. In 1337 Edward III of England had pressed his claims to the French throne, beginning a long-running conflict that became known as the Hundred Years War. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England.[25] By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in Calais and Brest alone, for example, were costing £36,000 a year to support, while military expeditions could consume £50,000 in only six months.[26][nb 1] Edward died in 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson, Richard II, then only ten years old.[28]

Richard's government was formed around his uncles, most prominently the rich and powerful John of Gaunt, and many of his grandfather's former senior officials. They faced the challenge of financially sustaining the war in France. Taxes in the 14th century were raised on an ad hoc basis through Parliament, then comprising the Lords, the titled aristocracy and clergy; and the Commons, the representatives of the knights, merchants and senior gentry from across England.[29] These taxes were typically imposed on a household's movable possessions, such as their goods or stock.[30] The raising of these taxes affected the members of the Commons much more than the Lords.[31] To exacerbate matters, the official statistics used to administrate the taxes predated the Black Death and, since the size and wealth of local communities no longer bore much resemblance to the pre-plague figures, effective collection had become increasingly difficult.[32]
Just before Edward's death, Parliament introduced a new form of taxation called the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples.[33][nb 2] Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000.[33] The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds.[35] The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption.[36] A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms.[37] Tax evasion proved to be a problem, and it only raised £18,600, much less than the £50,000 that had been hoped for.[38]
In November 1380, Parliament was called together again in Northampton. Archbishop Simon Sudbury, the new Lord Chancellor, updated the Commons on the worsening situation in France, a collapse in international trade, and the risk of the Crown having to default on its debts.[39] The Commons were told that the colossal sum of £160,000 was now required in new taxes, and arguments ensued between the royal council and Parliament about what to do next.[40] Parliament passed a third poll tax, this time on a flat-rate basis of 12 pence on each person over 15, with no allowance made for married couples, which they estimated would raise £66,666.[41] The third poll tax was highly unpopular and many in the south-east evaded it by refusing to register.[42] The royal council appointed new commissioners in March 1381 to interrogate local village and town officials in an attempt to find those who were refusing to comply.[43] The extraordinary powers and interference of these teams of investigators in local communities, primarily in the south-east and east of England, raised still further the tensions surrounding the fresh taxes.[44]
Protest and authority[edit source | edit]

The decades running up to 1381 were a rebellious, troubled period.[45] London was a particular locus for unrest, and the activities of the city's politically active guilds and fraternities often alarmed the authorities.[46] Londoners were unhappy with the expansion of the royal legal system in the capital, in particular the increased role of the Marshalsea Court in Southwark, which had begun to compete with the city authorities for judicial power in London.[47][nb 3] The city's population also resented the presence of foreigners, Flemish weavers in particular.[49] Londoners detested John of Gaunt because he was a supporter of the religious reformer John Wycliffe, whom the London public regarded as a heretic.[50] John of Gaunt was also engaged in a feud with the London elite and was rumoured to be planning to replace the elected Mayor with a captain, appointed by the Crown.[51] The London elite were themselves fighting out a vicious, internal battle for political power.[52] As a result, in 1381 the ruling classes in London were unstable and divided.[53]
Rural communities, particularly in the south-east, were unhappy with the operation of serfdom and the use of the local manorial courts to exact traditional fines and levies, not least because the same landowners who were running these courts also often acted as enforcers of the unpopular labour laws or as royal judges.[54] Many of the village elites refused to take up positions in local government and began to frustrate the operation of the courts.[55] Animals seized by the courts began to be "rescued" by their owners, and legal officials were assaulted.[56] Some started to advocate the creation of independent village communities, respecting traditional laws but separate from the hated legal system centred in London.[57] As the historian Miri Rubin describes, for many, "the problem was not the country's laws, but those charged with applying and safeguarding them".[58]
Concerns were raised about these changes in society.[59] William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman in the years before 1380, praising peasants who respected the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages.[60] The poet John Gower feared England might see an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters.[61] There was a moral panic about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters.[62] New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands.[63] By the 1370s, there were even fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.[18]
The discontent began to give way to open protest. In 1377, the "Great Rumour" occurred in south-east and south-west England.[64] Rural workers organised themselves and refused to work for their lords, arguing that, according to the Domesday Book, they were exempted from such requests.[65] The workers made unsuccessful appeals to the law courts and the King.[66] There were also widespread urban tensions, particularly in London, where John of Gaunt only narrowly escaped being lynched.[67] The troubles increased again in 1380, with protests and disturbances across the north of England and in the western towns of Shrewsbury and Bridgwater.[68] An uprising occurred in York, during which John de Gisborne, the city's mayor, was removed from office, and fresh tax riots followed in early 1381.[69] There was a great storm in England during May 1381, which many felt to prophesy future change and upheaval, adding further to the disturbed mood.[70]
Events[edit source | edit]

Outbreak of revolt[edit source | edit]
Essex and Kent[edit source | edit]
The revolt of 1381 broke out in Essex, following the arrival of John Bampton to investigate non-payment of the poll tax on 30 May.[71] Bampton was a member of Parliament, a Justice of the Peace and well-connected with royal circles.[71] He based himself in the town of Brentwood and summoned representatives from the neighbouring villages of Corringham, Fobbing and Stanford-le-Hope to explain and make good the shortfalls on 1 June.[71] The villagers appear to have arrived well-organised, and armed with old bows and sticks.[72] Bampton first interrogated the people of Fobbing, whose representative, Thomas Baker, declared that his village had already paid their taxes, and that no more money would be forthcoming.[72] When Bampton and two sergeants attempted to arrest Baker, violence broke out.[71] Bampton escaped and retreated to London, but three of his clerks and several of the Brentwood townsfolk who had agreed to act as jurors were killed.[73] Robert Bealknap, the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, who was probably already holding court in the area, was empowered to arrest and deal with the perpetrators.[74]

By the next day, the revolt was rapidly growing.[75] The villagers spread the news across the region, and John Geoffrey, a local bailiff, rode between Brentwood and Chelmsford, rallying support.[75] On 4 June, the rebels gathered at the village of Bocking, where their future plans seem to have been discussed.[76] The Essex rebels, possibly a few thousand strong, advanced towards London, some probably travelling directly and others via Kent.[75] One group, under the leadership of John Wrawe, a former chaplain, marched north towards the neighbouring county of Suffolk, with the intention of raising a revolt there.[77]
Meanwhile, revolt also flared in neighbouring Kent.[78] Sir Simon de Burley, a close associate of both Edward III and the young Richard, had claimed that a man in Kent, called Robert Belling, was an escaped serf from one of his estates.[78] Burley sent two sergeants to Gravesend, where Belling was living, to reclaim him.[78] Gravesend's local bailiffs and Belling tried to negotiate a solution under which Burley would accept a sum of money in return for dropping his case, but this failed and Belling was taken away to be imprisoned at Rochester Castle.[78] A furious group of local people gathered at Dartford, possibly on 5 June, to discuss the matter.[79] From there the rebels travelled to Maidstone, where the gaol was stormed, and then onto Rochester on 6 June.[80] Faced by the angry crowds, the constable in charge of Rochester Castle surrendered it without a fight and Belling was freed.[81]
Some of the Kentish crowds now dispersed, but others decided to continue.[81] From this point, they appear to have been led by Wat Tyler, whom the Anonimalle Chronicle suggests was elected their leader at a large gathering at Maidstone on 7 June.[82] Relatively little is known about Tyler's former life; chroniclers suggest that he was from Essex, had served in France as an archer and was a charismatic and capable leader.[82] Several chroniclers believe that he was responsible for shaping the political aims of the revolt.[83] Some also mention a Jack Straw as a leader among the Kentish rebels during this phase in the revolt, but it is uncertain if this was a real person, or a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or John Wrawe.[84][nb 4]
Tyler and the Kentish men advanced to Canterbury, being allowed into the walled city and castle without resistance on 10 June.[86] The rebels deposed the absent Archbishop of Canterbury, Sudbury, and made the cathedral monks swear loyalty to their cause.[87] They attacked properties in the city with links to the hated royal council, and searched the city for suspected enemies, dragging the suspects out of their houses and executing them.[88] The city gaol was opened and the prisoners freed.[89] Tyler then persuaded a few thousand of the rebels to leave Canterbury and advance with him on London the next morning.[90]
March on the capital[edit source | edit]

The Kentish advance on London appears to have been coordinated with the movement of the rebels in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk.[90] Their forces were armed with a mixture of weaponry, including sticks, battle axes, old swords and bows.[91][nb 5] Along their way, they encountered Lady Joan, the King's mother, who was travelling back to the capital to avoid being caught up in the revolt; she was mocked but otherwise left unharmed.[90] The Kentish rebels reached Blackheath, just south-east of the capital, on 12 June.[90][nb 6]
Meanwhile, word of the revolt reached the King at Windsor Castle on the night of 10 June.[90] He travelled by boat down the Thames to London the next day, taking up residence in the powerful fortress of the Tower of London for safety, where he was joined by his mother, Archbishop Sudbury, the Lord High Treasurer Sir Robert Hales, the Earls of Arundel, Salisbury and Warwick and a number of other senior nobles.[94] A delegation, headed by Thomas Brinton, the Bishop of Rochester, was sent out from London to negotiate with the rebels and persuade them to return home.[90]
At Blackheath, John Ball gave a famous sermon to the assembled Kentishmen.[95] Ball was a well-known priest and radical preacher from Kent, who was by now closely associated with Tyler.[96] Chroniclers' accounts vary as to how he came to be involved in the revolt; he may have been released from Maidstone gaol by the crowds, or might have been already at liberty when the revolt broke out.[97] Ball rhetorically asked the crowds "When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then a gentleman?" and promoted the rebel slogan "With King Richard and the true commons of England".[95] The phrases emphasised the rebel opposition to the continuation of serfdom and to the hierarchies of the Church and State that separated the citizen from the King, while stressing that they were loyal to the monarchy and, unlike the King's advisors, were "true" to Richard.[98] The rebels rejected proposals from the Bishop of Rochester that they should return home, and instead prepared to march on.[90]
Discussions took place in the Tower of London about how to deal with the revolt.[90] The King had only a small number of troops at hand, in the form of the castle's garrison, his immediate bodyguard and, at most, several hundred soldiers.[99][nb 7] Many of the more experienced military commanders were in France, Ireland and Germany, and the nearest major military force was in the north of England, guarding against a potential Scottish invasion.[101] Resistance in the provinces was also complicated by English law, which stated that only the King could summon local militias or lawfully execute rebels and criminals, leaving many local lords unwilling to attempt to suppress the uprisings on their own authority.[102]
Since the Blackheath negotiations had failed, the decision was taken that the King himself should meet the rebels, at Greenwich, on the south side of the Thames.[103] Guarded by four barges of soldiers, Richard sailed from the Tower on the morning of 13 June, where he was met on the other side by the rebel crowds.[104] The negotiations failed, as Richard was unwilling to come ashore and the rebels refused to enter discussions until he did.[104] Richard returned across the river to the Tower.[105]

The rebels began to cross from Southwark onto London Bridge on the afternoon of 13 June.[105] The defences on London Bridge were opened from the inside, either in sympathy for the rebel cause or simply out of fear, and the rebels advanced into the city.[106][nb 8] At the same time, the rebel force from Essex made its way towards Aldgate on the north side of the city.[108] The rebels swept west through the centre of the city, and Aldgate was opened to let the rest of the rebels in.[109]
The Kentish rebels had assembled a wide-ranging list of people whom they wanted the King to hand over for execution.[104] It included national figures, such as John of Gaunt, Archbishop Sudbury and Hales; other key members of the royal council; officials, such as Bealknap and Bampton who had intervened in Kent; and other hated members of the wider royal circle.[104] When they reached the Marshalsea Prison in Southwark, they tore it apart.[110] By now the Kent and Essex rebels had been joined by many rebellious Londoners.[111] The Fleet and Newgate Prisons were attacked by the crowds, and the rebels also targeted houses belonging to Flemish immigrants.[112]
On the north side of London, the rebels approached Smithfield and Clerkenwell Priory, the headquarters of the Knights Hospitaller which was headed by Hales.[113] The priory was destroyed, along with the nearby manor.[113] Heading westwards along Fleet Street, the rebels attacked the Temple, a complex of legal buildings and offices owned by the Hospitallers.[114] The contents, books and paperwork were brought out and burned in the street, and the buildings systematically demolished.[114] Meanwhile, John Fordham, the Keeper of the Privy Seal and one of the men on the rebel's execution list, narrowly escaped when the crowds ransacked his accommodation but failed to notice he was still in the building.[114]
Next to be attacked along Fleet Street was the Savoy Palace, a huge, luxurious building belonging to John of Gaunt.[115] According to the chronicler Henry Knighton it contained "such quantities of vessels and silver plate, without counting the parcel-gilt and solid gold, that five carts would hardly suffice to carry them"; official estimates placed the value of the contents at around £10,000.[115] The interior was systematically destroyed by the rebels, who burnt the soft furnishings, smashed the precious metal work, crushed the gems, set fire to the Duke's records and threw the remains into the Thames and the city drains.[115] Symbolically, almost nothing was actually stolen by the rebels, who declared themselves to be "zealots for truth and justice, not thieves and robbers".[116] The remains of the building were then set alight.[117] In the evening, rebel forces gathered outside the Tower of London, from where the King watched the fires burning across the city.[118]
Taking the Tower of London[edit source | edit]

On the morning of 14 June, the crowd continued west along the Thames, burning the houses of officials around Westminster and opening the Westminster gaol.[119] They then moved back into central London, setting fire to more buildings and storming the Newgate prison.[119] The hunt for Flemings continued, and those with Flemish-sounding accents were killed, including the royal advisor, Richard Lyons.[120][nb 9] In one city ward, the bodies of 40 executed Flemings were piled up in the street, and at the Church of St Martin Vintry, popular with the Flemish, 35 of the community were killed.[122] Historian Rodney Hilton argues that these attacks may have been coordinated by the weavers' guilds of London, who were commercial competitors of the Flemish weavers.[123]
Isolated inside the Tower, the royal government was in a state of shock at the turn of events.[124] The decision was taken, possibly by Richard himself, for the King to leave the castle that morning and make his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him.[125] This involved the King leaving Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers.[126] Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.[127]
It is uncertain who spoke for the rebels at Mile End, and Wat Tyler may not have been present on this occasion, but they appear to have put forward their various demands to the King, including the surrender of the hated officials on their lists for execution; the abolition of serfdom and unfree tenure; "that there should be no law within the realm save the law of Winchester", and a general amnesty for the rebels.[128] It is unclear precisely what was meant by the law of Winchester, but it probably referred to the rebel ideal of self-regulating village communities.[129][nb 10] Richard issued charters announcing the abolition of serfdom, which immediately began to be disseminated around the country.[131] He declined to hand over any of his officials, however, apparently instead promising that he would personally implement any justice that was required.[132]
While Richard was at Mile End, the Tower was taken by the rebels.[133] A force of rebels, separate from those operating under Tyler at Mile End, approached the castle, possibly in the late morning.[133][nb 11] The gates were open to receive Richard on his return and a crowd of around 400 rebels entered the fortress, encountering no resistance, possibly because the guards were terrified by the rebels.[134]
Once inside, the rebels began to hunt down their key targets, and found Archbishop Sudbury and Robert Hales in the chapel of the White Tower.[135] Along with William Appleton, John of Gaunt's physician, and John Legge, a royal sergeant, they were taken out to Tower Hill and beheaded.[135] Their heads were paraded around the city, before being affixed to London Bridge.[136] The rebels found John of Gaunt's son, the future Henry IV, and were about to execute him as well, when John Ferrour, one of the royal guards, successfully interceded on his behalf.[137] The rebels also discovered Lady Joan and Joan Holland, Richard's sister, in the castle but, after making fun of the pair, let them go unharmed.[138] The castle was thoroughly looted of armour and royal paraphernalia.[139]
In the aftermath of the attack, Richard did not return to the Tower but instead travelled from Mile End to the Great Wardrobe, one of his royal houses in Blackfriars, part of south-west London.[140] There he appointed the military commander Richard FitzAlan, the Earl of Arundel, to replace Sudbury as Chancellor, and began to make plans to regain an advantage over the rebels the following day.[141] Many of the Essex rebels now began to disperse, content with the King's promises, leaving Tyler and the Kentish forces the most significant faction in London.[142] Tyler's men moved around the city that evening, seeking out and killing John of Gaunt's employees, foreigners and anyone associated with the legal system.[143]

On 15 June the royal government and the remaining rebels, who were unsatisfied with the charters granted the previous day, agreed to meet at Smithfield, just outside the city walls.[144] London remained in confusion, with various bands of rebels roaming the city independently.[139] Richard prayed at Westminster Abbey, before setting out for the meeting in the late afternoon.[145] The chronicler accounts of the encounter all vary on matters of detail, but agree on the broad sequence of events.[146] The King and his party, at least 200 strong and including men-at-arms, positioned themselves outside St Bartholomew's Priory on the east side of Smithfield, and the thousands of rebels massed along the western end.[147][nb 12]
Richard probably called Tyler forwards from the crowd to meet him, and Tyler greeted the King with what the royal party considered excessive familiarity, terming Richard his "brother" and promising him his friendship.[149] Richard queried why Tyler and the rebels had not yet left London following the signing of the charters the previous day, but this brought an angry rebuke from Tyler, who requested that a further charter be drawn up.[150] The rebel leader rudely demanded refreshment and, once this had been provided, attempted to leave.[151]
An argument then broke out between Tyler and some of the royal servants.[151] The Mayor of London, William Walworth, stepped forward to intervene, Tyler made some motion towards the King, and the royal soldiers leapt in.[152] Either Walworth or Richard ordered Tyler to be arrested, Tyler attempted to attack the Mayor, and Walworth responded by stabbing Tyler.[151] Ralph Standish, a royal squire, then repeatedly stabbed Tyler with his sword, mortally injuring him.[153]
The situation was now precarious and violence appeared likely as the rebels prepared to unleash a volley of arrows.[153] Richard rode forwards towards the crowd and persuaded them to follow him away from Smithfields, to Clerkenwell Fields, defusing the situation.[153] Walworth meanwhile began to regain control of the situation, backed by reinforcements from the city.[153] Tyler's head was cut off and displayed on a pole and, with their leader dead and the royal government now backed by the London militia, the rebel movement began to collapse.[154] Richard promptly knighted Walworth and his leading supporters for their services.[153]
Wider revolt[edit source | edit]

While the revolt was unfolding in London, John Wrawe led his force into Suffolk.[155] Wrawe had considerable influence over the development of the revolt across eastern England, where the number of rebels may well have approached those in the London revolt.[156] The authorities put up very little resistance to the revolt: the major nobles failed to organise defences, key fortifications fell easily to the rebels and the local militias were not mobilised.[157] As in London and the south-east, this was in part due to the absence of key military leaders and the nature of English law, but any locally recruited men may also have proved unreliable in the face of a popular uprising.[158]
On 12 June, Wrawe attacked Sir Richard Lyons' property at Overhall, advancing on to the towns of Cavendish and Bury St Edmunds in west Suffolk the next day, gathering further support as they went.[159] John Cambridge, the Prior of the wealthy Bury St Edmunds Abbey, was disliked in the town, and Wrawe allied himself with the townspeople and stormed the abbey.[160] The Prior escaped, but was found two days later and beheaded.[161] A small band of rebels marched north to Thetford to extort protection money from the town, and another group tracked down Sir John Cavendish, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[162] Cavendish was caught in Lakenheath and killed.[163] John Battisford and Thomas Sampson independently led a revolt near Ipswich on the 14 June.[164] They took the town without opposition and looted the properties of the archdeacon and local tax officials.[164] The violence spread out further, with attacks on numerous properties and the burning of the local court records.[165] One official, Edmund Lakenheath, was forced to flee from the Suffolk coast by boat.[166]
Revolt began to stir in the town of St Albans in Hertfordshire late on 13 June, when news broke of the events in London.[167] There had been long-running disagreements in St Albans between the town and the local abbey, which had extensive privileges in the region.[168] On 14 June, protesters met with the Abbot, Thomas de la Mare, and demanded their freedom from the abbey.[167] A group of townsmen under the leadership of William Grindecobbe traveled to London, where they appealed to the King for the rights of the abbey to be abolished.[169] Wat Tyler, then still in control of the city, granted them authority in the meantime to take direct action against the abbey.[170] Grindecobbe and the rebels returned to St Albans, where they found the Prior had already fled.[171] The rebels broke open the abbey gaol, destroyed the fences marking out the abbey lands and burnt the abbey records in the town square.[172] They then forced Thomas de la Mare to surrender the abbey's rights in a charter on 16 June.[173] The revolt against the abbey spread out over the next few days, with abbey property and financial records being destroyed across the county.[174]

On 15 June, revolt broke out in Cambridgeshire, led by elements of Wrawe's Suffolk rebellion and some local men, such as John Greyston, who had been involved in the events in London and had returned to his home county to spread the revolt, and Geoffrey Cobbe and John Hanchach, members of the local gentry.[175] The University of Cambridge, staffed by priests and enjoying special royal privileges, was widely hated by the other inhabitants of the town.[175] A revolt backed by the Mayor of Cambridge broke out with the University as its main target.[175] The rebels ransacked Corpus Christi College, which had connections to John of Gaunt, and the University's church, and attempted to execute the University bedel, who escaped.[176] The University's library and archives were burnt in the centre of the town.[177] The next day, the University was forced to negotiate a new charter, giving up its royal privileges.[178] Revolt then spread north from Cambridge toward Ely, where the gaol was opened and the local Justice of the Peace executed.[179]
In Norfolk, the revolt was led by Geoffrey Litster, a weaver, and Sir Roger Bacon, a local lord with ties to the Suffolk rebels.[180] Litster began sending out messengers across the county in a call to arms on 14 June, and isolated outbreaks of violence occurred.[181] The rebels assembled on 17 June outside the city of Norwich and killed Sir Robert Salle, who was in charge of the city defences and had attempted to negotiate a settlement.[182] The people of the town then opened the gates to let the rebels in.[182] They began looting buildings and killed Reginald Eccles, a local official.[183] William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk fled his estates, travelling in disguise to London.[184] The other leading members of the local gentry were captured and forced to play out the roles of a royal household, working for Litster.[184] Violence spread out across the county, as gaols were opened, Flemish immigrants killed, court records burned, and property looted and destroyed.[185]

Revolts also occurred across the rest of England, particularly in the cities of the north, traditionally centres of political unrest.[186] In the town of Beverley, violence broke out between the richer mercantile elite and the poorer townspeople during May.[187] By the end of the month the rebels had taken power and replaced the former town administration with their own.[188] The rebels attempted to enlist the support of Alexander Neville, the Archbishop of York, and in June forced the former town government to agree to arbitration through Neville.[189] Peace was restored in June 1382 but tensions continued to simmer for many years.[190]
Word of the troubles in the south-east spread northwards, slowed by the poor communication links of medieval England.[191] In Leicester, where John of Gaunt had a substantial castle, warnings arrived of a force of rebels advancing on the city from Lincolnshire, who were intent on destroying the castle and its contents.[191] The mayor and the town mobilised their defences, including a local militia, but the rebels never materialised.[192] John of Gaunt himself was in Berwick when word reached him on 17 June of the revolt.[193] Not knowing that Wat Tyler had by now been killed, John of Gaunt placed his castles in Yorkshire and Wales on alert.[194] Fresh rumours, many of them incorrect, continued to arrive in Berwick, suggesting widespread rebellions across the west and east of England and the looting of the ducal household in Leicester; rebel units were even said to be hunting for the Duke himself.[194] Gaunt began to march to Bamburgh Castle, but then changed course and diverted north into Scotland, only returning south once the fighting was over.[195]
News of the initial events in London also reached York around 17 June, and attacks at once broke out on the properties of the Dominican friars, the Franciscan friaries and other religious institutions.[196] Violence continued over the coming weeks, and on 1 July a group of armed men, under the command of John de Gisbourne, forced their way into the city and attempted to seize control.[197] The Mayor, Simon de Quixlay, gradually began to reclaim some semblance of authority, but order was not properly restored until 1382.[197] The news of the southern revolt reached Scarborough where riots broke out against the ruling elite on 23 June, with the rebels dressed in white hoods with a red tail at the back.[198] Members of the local government were deposed from office, and one tax collector was nearly lynched.[199] By 1382, however, the elite had re-established power.[200]
In the Somerset town of Bridgwater, revolt broke out on 19 June, led by Thomas Ingleby and Adam Brugge.[201] The crowds attacked the local Augustine house and forced their master to give up his local privileges and pay a ransom.[202] The rebels then turned on the properties of John Sydenham, a local merchant and official, looting his manor and burning paperwork, before executing Walter Baron, a local man.[203] The Ilchester gaol was stormed, and one unpopular prisoner executed.[204]
Suppression[edit source | edit]

The royal suppression of the revolt began shortly after the death of Wat Tyler on 15 June.[205] Sir Robert Knolles, Sir Nicholas Brembre and Sir Robert Launde were appointed to restore control in the capital.[206] A summons was put out for soldiers, probably around 4,000 men were mustered in London, and expeditions to the other troubled parts of the country soon followed.[207]
The revolt in East Anglia was independently suppressed by Henry le Despenser, the Bishop of Norwich.[184] Henry was in Stamford in Lincolnshire when the revolt broke out, and when he found out about the events he marched south with eight men-at-arms and a small force of archers, gathering more forces as he went.[208] He marched first to Peterborough, where he routed the local rebels and executed any he could capture, including some who had taken shelter in the local abbey.[209] He then headed south-east via Huntingdon and Ely, reaching Cambridge on the 19 June, and then heading further into the rebel controlled areas of Norfolk.[210] Henry reclaimed the city of Norwich on 24 June, before heading out with a company of men to track down the rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster.[211] The two forces met at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June; the Bishop's forces triumphed and Litster was captured and executed.[212] Henry's quick action was essential to the suppression of the revolt in East Anglia, but he was very unusual in taking matters into his own hands in this way, and his execution of the rebels without royal sanction was illegal.[213]
On 17 June, the King dispatched his half-brother Thomas Holland and Sir Thomas Trivet to Kent with a small force to restore order.[214] They held courts at Maidstone and Rochester.[214] William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk, returned to his county on 23 June, accompanied by a force of 500 men.[215] He quickly subdued the area and was soon holding court in Mildenhall, where many of the accused were sentenced to death.[216] He moved on into Norfolk on 6 July, holding court in Norwich, Great Yarmouth and Hacking.[214] Hugh, Lord la Zouche, led the legal proceedings against the rebels in Cambridgeshire.[214] In St Albans, the Abbot arrested William Grindecobbe and his main supporters.[217]
On 20 June, the King's uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, and Robert Tresilian, the replacement Chief Justice, were given special commissions across the whole of England.[214] Thomas oversaw court cases in Essex, backed up by a substantial military force as resistance was continuing and the county was still in a state of unrest.[218] Richard himself visited Essex, where he met with a rebel delegation seeking confirmation of the grants the King had given at Mile End.[219] Richard rejected them, allegedly telling them that "rustics you were and rustics you are still. You will remain in bondage, not as before, but incomparably harsher".[219][nb 13] Tresilian soon joined Thomas, and carried out 31 executions in Chelmsford, before travelling on to St Albans in July for further court trials, which appear to have utilised dubious techniques to ensure convictions.[221] Thomas went on to Gloucester with 200 soldiers to suppress the unrest there.[222] Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland, was tasked to restore order to Yorkshire.[222]
A wide range of laws were invoked in the process of the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or demolishing houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time.[223] The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle.[224] Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace.[225] Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court.[225] It was not until 1387 before the last of these cases had been resolved.[225]
The rebel leaders were quickly rounded up.[226] A rebel leader called Jack Straw was captured in London and executed.[227] John Ball was caught in Coventry, and tried in St Albans, being executed on 15 July.[228] Grindecobbe was also tried and executed in St Albans.[227] John Wrawe was tried in London; he probably gave evidence against 24 of his colleagues in the hope of a pardon, but was sentenced to be executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered on 6 May 1382.[229] Sir Roger Bacon was probably arrested before the final battle in Norfolk, and was tried and imprisoned in the Tower of London before finally being pardoned by the Crown.[230] As of September 1381, Thomas Ingleby of Bridgwater had successfully evaded the authorities.[231]
Aftermath[edit source | edit]
Medieval painting

The royal government and Parliament began to re-establish the normal processes of government after the revolt; as the historian Michael Postan describes, the uprising was in many ways a "passing episode".[232] On 30 June, the King ordered England's serfs to return to their previous conditions of service, and on 2 July the royal charters signed under duress during the rising were formally revoked.[214] Parliament met in November to discuss the events of the year and how best to respond to their challenges.[233] The revolt was blamed on the misconduct of royal officials, who, it was argued, had been excessively greedy and overbearing.[234] The Commons stood behind the existing labour laws, but requested changes in the royal council, which Richard granted.[235] Richard also granted general pardons to those who had executed rebels without due process, to all men who had remained loyal, and to all those who had rebelled – with the exception of the men of Bury St Edmunds, any men who had been involved in the killing of the King's advisers, and those who were still on the run from prison.[236]
Despite the violence of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades.[237] Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts.[238] Low-level unrest, however, continued for several more years.[239] In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon.[240] When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.[241]
There were no further attempts by Parliament to impose a poll-tax or to reform England's fiscal system.[242] The Commons instead concluded at the end of 1381 that the military effort on the Continent should be "carefully but substantially reduced".[243] Unable to raise fresh taxes, the government had to curtail its foreign policy and military expeditions and began to examine the options for peace.[244] The institution of serfdom declined after 1381, but primarily for economic rather than political reasons.[245] Rural wages continued to increase, and lords increasingly sold their serfs freedom in exchange for cash, or converted traditional forms of tenure to new leasehold arrangements.[246] Over the course of the 15th century, the institution vanished in England.[241]
Rebels[edit source | edit]

Medieval painting

14th-century rural scene of reeve directing serfs, from the Queen Mary Psalter
Chroniclers primarily described the rebels as rural serfs, using broad, derogatory Latin terms such as serviles rustici, servile genu and rustictas.[247] Some chroniclers, however, including Knighton, noted the presence of runaway apprentices, artisans and others, sometimes terming them the "lesser commons".[247] The evidence from the court records following the revolt, albeit biased in various ways, similarly shows the involvement of a much broader community, and the earlier perception that the rebels were only constituted of unfree serfs is now rejected.[248][nb 14]
The rural rebels came from a wide range of backgrounds, but typically they were, as the historian Christopher Dyer describes, "people well below the ranks of the gentry, but who mainly held some land and goods", and not the very poorest in society, who formed a minority of the rebel movement.[250] Many had held positions of authority in local village governance, and these seem to have provided leadership to the revolt.[251] Some were artisans, including, as the historian Rodney Hilton lists, "carpenters, sawyers, masons, cobblers, tailors, weavers, fullers, glovers, hosiers, skinners, bakers, butchers, innkeepers, cooks and a lime-burner".[252] They were predominantly male, but with some women in their ranks.[253] The rebels were typically illiterate; only between 5 and 15 per cent of England could read during this period.[254] They also came from a broad range of local communities, including at least 330 south-eastern villages.[255]
Many of the rebels had urban backgrounds, and the majority of those involved in the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants.[256] In some cases, the townsfolk who joined the revolt were the urban poor, attempting to gain at the expense of the local elites.[257] In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled.[123] Alternatively, some urban rebels were themselves part of that elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds.[258] In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful.[259]
The vast majority of those involved in the revolt of 1381 were not represented in Parliament and were excluded from its decision-making.[260] In a few cases, however, the rebels were led or joined by relatively prosperous members of the gentry, such as Sir Roger Bacon in Norfolk.[261] Some of these later claimed to have been forced to join the revolt by the rebels.[262] A number of clergy also formed part of the revolt; in addition to the more prominent leaders, such as John Ball or John Wrawe, nearly 20 are mentioned in the records of the revolt in the south-east.[263] Some were pursuing local grievances, some were disadvantaged and suffering relative poverty, while others appear to have been motivated by strong radical beliefs.[264]
Many of those involved in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings.[265] They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories.[266] One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem.[267] Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.[268]

Historiography[edit source | edit]

Historian William Stubbs, who considered the revolt "one of the most portentous events in the whole of our history", painted by Hubert von Herkomer.[269]
Contemporary chroniclers of the events in the revolt have formed an important source for historians. The chroniclers were biased against the rebel cause and typically portrayed the rebels, in the words of the historian Susan Crane, as "beasts, monstrosities or misguided fools".[270] London chroniclers were also unwilling to admit the role of ordinary Londoners in the revolt, preferring to place the blame entirely on rural peasants from the south-east.[271] Among the key accounts was the anonymous Anonimalle Chronicle, whose author appears to have been part of the royal court and an eye-witness to many of the events in London.[272] The chronicler Thomas Walsingham was present for much of the revolt, but focused his account on the terror of the social unrest and was extremely biased against the rebels.[273] Jean Froissart, the author of the Chronicles, had well-placed sources close to the revolt, but was inclined to elaborate the known facts with colourful stories.[274] No sympathetic accounts of the rebels survive.[93]
At the end of the 19th century there was a surge in historical interest in the Peasants' Revolt, spurred by the contemporary growth of the labour and socialist movements.[275] Work by Charles Oman, Edgar Powell, André Réville and G. M. Trevelyan established the course of the revolt.[276] By 1907 the accounts of the chroniclers were all widely available in print and the main public records concerning the events had been identified.[277] Réville began to use the legal indictments that had been used against suspected rebels after the revolt as a fresh source of historical information, and over the next century extensive research was carried out into the local economic and social history of the revolt, using scattered local sources across south-east England.[278]
Interpretations of the revolt have changed over the years. 17th-century historians, such John Smyth, established the idea that the revolt had marked the end of unfree labour and serfdom in England.[269] 19th-century historians such as William Stubbs and Thorold Rogers reinforced this conclusion, Stubbs describing it as "one of the most portentous events in the whole of our history".[269] In the 20th century, this interpretation was increasingly challenged by historians such as May McKisack, Michael Postan and Richard Dobson, who revised the impact of the revolt on further political and economic events in England.[279] Mid-20th century Marxist historians were both interested in, and generally sympathetic to, the rebel cause, a trend culminating in Hilton's 1973 account of the uprising, set against the context of wider peasant revolts across Europe during the period.[280] The Peasants' Revolt has received more academic attention than any other medieval revolt, and this research has been typically interdisciplinary in nature, involving historians, literary scholars and international collaboration.[281]

No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (No. 2 OCU) is a fighter training unit of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Located at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, the unit trains pilots to operate the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, conducts refresher courses for pilots returning to the type, and trains future Hornet instructors. Pilots new to the Hornet enter No. 2 OCU after first qualifying to fly fast jets at No. 79 Squadron and undertaking initial fighter combat instruction at No. 76 Squadron. Once qualified on the F/A-18, they are posted to one of No. 81 Wing's operational Hornet units, No. 3 Squadron, No. 75 Squadron or No. 77 Squadron.
The unit was established as No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No. 2 OTU) in April 1942. During World War II it provided training on a wide range of aircraft, including P-40 Kittyhawks, Vultee Vengeances, Avro Ansons, CAC Boomerangs, Supermarine Spitfires and Airspeed Oxfords. Disbanded in March 1947, No. 2 OTU was re-formed at Williamtown in March 1952 in response to the demand for more highly trained pilots in the Korean War. It was renamed No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958, and since then has conducted training with the CAC Sabre, Dassault Mirage III, and Macchi MB-326, prior to taking delivery of the Hornet.

The role of No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit (No. 2 OCU) is to "support the preparation for and the conduct of effective airspace control, counter air strike and combat air support operations through the provision of trained personnel".[1] Located at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, it comes under the control of No. 81 Wing, which is part of Air Combat Group. No. 2 OCU is primarily responsible for conducting operational conversion courses on the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet multi-role fighter, which entered service in 1985. The unit takes students who have converted to fast jets with No. 79 Squadron, located at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, and undergone lead-in fighter training at No. 76 Squadron, based at Williamtown.[1][2] Most students are new to operational flying, but some are "retreads" (experienced pilots converting from another aircraft type).[3] As No. 2 OCU's instructors are among the RAAF's most experienced Hornet pilots, they often play a significant role developing new tactics, in cooperation with fighter combat instructors at other No. 81 Wing units.[4]
No. 2 OCU operates both single-seat F/A-18A Hornets and two-seat F/A-18Bs.[5] The F/A-18B is largely identical to the A model aside from its dual cockpit, which reduces internal fuel capacity by around six per cent.[6] Aircraft livery includes a yellow-and-black tail fin flash, the base featuring a yellow tiger's head outlined in black, with a red mouth, white fangs and white eyes.[7] The unit motto is Juventus Non Sine Pinnis ("The Young Shall Have Wings").[8]
Hornet conversion courses run for six months, after which graduates are posted to one of the RAAF's front-line fighter units, No. 3 Squadron or No. 77 Squadron at Williamtown, or No. 75 Squadron at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory.[5][9] Students must first gain their instrument rating on the Hornet, and are then taught basic fighter manoeuvres, air combat techniques, air-to-air gunnery, and air-to-ground tactics.[3][4] The course culminates with Exercise High Sierra, a biannual event that was first run at Townsville, Queensland, in 1986.[4][8] The exercise lasts for two weeks and involves day and night flights, including precision strike sorties with practice and live bombs.[9]
In addition to operational conversion, No. 2 OCU conducts refresher courses and fighter combat instructor courses on the Hornet.[1] Pilots who have not flown Hornets for more than nine months undertake the two-week refresher course.[10] Fighter combat instructor courses run for five months and are given every two years.[1][11] Students are chosen from among the most experienced Hornet squadron pilots and undergo instruction in how to train others, as well as how to deal with complex operational scenarios.[3] This is tested in simulated combat with other types of US or RAAF aircraft, as available, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and F/A-18 Super Hornets.[3][11] Graduates become qualified F/A-18 instructors and initially remain with No. 2 OCU for the next two-year cycle. After this time they are posted to one of the front-line squadrons or No. 81 Wing's headquarters as a Hornet weapons-and-tactics specialist.[4]

Operational training: 1942–47[edit source | editbeta]
Four single-engined military monoplanes in flight

Wing Commander Jeffrey (front) leading a flight of P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, including one flown by Squadron Leader "Bluey" Truscott (second from rear), at No. 2 OTU, Mildura, in June 1942
During World War II, the RAAF established several operational training units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting techniques to the flying skills they had already learned.[12] No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit (No. 2 OTU) was formed on 2 April 1942 at Port Pirie, South Australia. Its inaugural commanding officer was Wing Commander Peter Jeffrey, a fighter ace who had led No. 3 Squadron in North Africa.[8][13] Jeffrey had recently brought on line Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons, two of the first three fighter units raised to help defend northern Australia as the Japanese advanced towards New Guinea.[13][14] His team of instructors at No. 2 OTU included fellow aces from the North African campaign, Clive Caldwell and Wilf Arthur.[15] Originally equipped with CAC Wirraways and Fairey Battles, the unit's complement was augmented by P-40 Kittyhawks, Vultee Vengeances, Avro Ansons, CAC Boomerangs, Supermarine Spitfires and Airspeed Oxfords after it relocated to RAAF Station Mildura, Victoria, in May.[8] By September 1942 its fleet of aircraft included nine of the 106 Kittyhawks the RAAF had on hand at the time.[16] During November, No. 2 OTU conducted comparative trials that pitted a Spitfire Mk V against a P-40E; the final report of these trials judged that while the Spitfire had superior performance according to most criteria, the P-40E was also a useful design.[17]
No. 2 OTU's Spitfire section was transferred to RAAF Station Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1943, under the command of ace John Waddy.[8][18] Jeffrey handed over command of No. 2 OTU in August 1943; the same month, the unit logged over 5,000 flying hours, its highest level during the war. For the remainder of the conflict it maintained an average strength of more than 100 aircraft.[8] North African campaign aces and former No. 3 Squadron commanders Bobby Gibbes and Nicky Barr served successively as chief flying instructor from March 1944 until the end of the Pacific War.[19][20] Group Captain Arthur led the unit from July to November 1944, when Group Captain Jeffrey resumed command.[8] During 1945 the Spitfires and Kittyhawks were replaced by 32 North American P-51 Mustangs.[21] Training concluded that October, following the cessation of hostilities, and No. 2 OTU was reduced to a care-and-maintenance unit.[1][8] During the war it had graduated 1,247 pilots, losing 45 students in fatal accidents.[8] Jeffrey completed his appointment in June 1946, and the unit was disbanded on 25 March 1947.[8][22]
Operational training: 1952–58[edit source | editbeta]

No. 2 OCU Vampire during the 1950s
Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of all the RAAF's OTUs, including No. 2 OTU.[8][12] Operational conversion of new pilots then became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice disrupted the squadrons' normal duties, while the advent of the Korean War and the introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal system of operational training.[12] According to Dick Cresswell, commanding officer of No. 77 Squadron in Korea from September 1950 to August 1951:[23]
It is hard to believe that I actually sent 11 pilots home to Australia as they were not capable of doing the job properly. I don't blame the pilots, but I do blame the Air Force system. We had no operational training units, no operational training system and, as a result, the pilots came to Korea poorly trained and without instrument ratings. They just couldn't operate in the area.
The RAAF moved to rectify the situation by re-forming No. 2 OTU on 1 March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations.[12] Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and de Havilland Vampire jets.[8][24] Cresswell took command of No. 2 OTU on 21 May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as refresher courses on jets.[8] Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built CAC Sabre jet fighter to No. 2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight.[8][25] The flight was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, in concert with the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU).[26] On 3 December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No. 2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No. 77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance.[27] Training courses on the Sabre began on 1 January 1955.[8] Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No. 3 Squadron.[26] Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No. 2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.[12]
Operational conversion: 1958–current[edit source | editbeta]

In May 1958, No. 1 Applied Flying Training School began equipping with Vampire jet trainers at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia.[28] As RAAF pilots were now gaining their first exposure to jets elsewhere, No. 2 OTU took over from the fighter squadrons the responsibility of converting trained jet pilots to Sabres.[12] Reflecting its new primary role, it was renamed No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit (No. 2 OCU) in September 1958, and ceased Vampire courses the same month.[8][12] Wing Commander Neville McNamara, later Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) and Chief of the Defence Force Staff, served as commanding officer from August 1959 until January 1961.[8][29] During his tenure, the unit undertook exercises with No. 75 Squadron at RAAF Bases Amberley, Townsville and Darwin.[30] Two Sabre pilots from No. 2 OCU and one from No. 75 Squadron died in separate incidents early in 1960; each had attempted to eject at low level and suffered fatal head injuries from colliding with the aircraft's canopy during the ejection sequence. All RAAF Sabres were grounded until ARDU developed a modification to shatter the canopy immediately before the pilot ejected.[30][31]
Along with Nos. 75 and 76 Squadrons, also based at Williamtown, No. 2 OCU was under the control of No. 81 Wing from 1961 until the wing was disbanded in 1966.[32][33] By late 1963, personnel were busy developing training material for the pending Sabre replacement, the Dassault Mirage III, a task that required them to translate the manufacturer's technical documentation from the original French.[34][35] No. 2 OCU received its first Mirages in February and March 1964.[34] It commenced conversion courses on the type that October, and fighter combat instructor courses in August 1968.[35] The RAAF eventually took delivery of 100 Mirage IIIO single-seat fighters and 16 Mirage IIID two-seat trainers; No. 2 OCU operated both models.[36] Squadron Leader John Newham, later to serve as CAS, held temporary command of the unit from July 1965 to April 1966.[37][38] A Sabre-equipped aerobatic display team named the "Marksmen" was formed within No. 2 OCU during 1966 and 1967.[39] Between 1967 and 1984, six of the unit's Mirages suffered major accidents, resulting in three fatalities.[36] Experience in the Vietnam War led the RAAF to begin training forward air controllers in 1968. The task initially fell to No. 2 OCU before a specialised unit, No. 4 Forward Air Control Flight, was formed in 1970.[40] In October 1969, the OCU began operating the Macchi MB-326 jet for lead-in fighter training, in addition to the Mirage. Macchi courses were transferred to No. 5 Operational Training Unit in April 1970, but returned to No. 2 OCU in July the following year.[8]

In preparation for the introduction of the F/A-18 Hornet, No. 2 OCU temporarily ceased flying operations on 1 January 1985 and transferred Macchi and Mirage training to No. 77 Squadron, which assumed responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses.[8][41] Beginning on 17 May, the first fourteen Australian Hornets—seven single-seat F/A-18As and seven two-seat F/A-18Bs—and a Hornet simulator were delivered to No. 2 OCU. Conversion courses on the type commenced on 19 August with four F/A-18Bs and three students.[5][42] No. 2 OCU has remained the prime user of the two-seat Hornet, though some are operated by the fighter squadrons, Nos. 3, 75 and 77.[5] The first year of Hornet service saw No. 2 OCU, as the-then only RAAF operator, undertake demonstration flights around the country to unveil the new fighter to the Australian public.[43] All of the Hornet units came under the control of a newly re-formed No. 81 Wing on 2 February 1987.[5][33] An intense training program that year resulted in 21 pilots converting to the type.[43] In June 1987, Macchi training courses again became the responsibility of No. 2 OCU; this role was taken over by No. 76 Squadron in January 1989.[8] No. 2 OCU suffered its only Hornet loss to date when an F/A-18B crashed at Great Palm Island, Queensland, during a night-time training flight on 18 November 1987, killing the pilot. Two Hornets collided during an air-to-air combat training exercise the previous year, but both managed to return to base.[44] The unit temporarily relocated to RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in July 1990, while Williamtown's runway was resurfaced.[45]
The RAAF began modifying four of its Boeing 707 jet transports to enable air-to-air refuelling of the Hornets in December 1988; No. 2 OCU staff commenced training for airborne tanker operations in July 1991, subsequently adding this capability to the Hornet conversion course.[8][46] By the mid-1990s, the unit had 12 instructors and a complement of 18 Hornets, including 13 two-seaters. It was running two conversion courses per year, with eight students per course, and had an average failure rate of 10 per cent. Several of its instructors were US and Canadian pilots on exchange with the RAAF.[3] In 2000, No. 2 OCU joined Nos. 76 and 79 Squadrons as part of No. 78 Wing, which had been re-established as an operational training formation.[47][48] As of 2005, the unit had a strength of between 12 and 14 instructors and ran three Hornet conversion courses and one fighter combat instructor course over two-year cycles. About six new Hornet pilots took part in each of the conversion courses, and the unit generally graduated 15 new Hornet pilots over each cycle.[4] By 2007, No. 2 OCU had returned to the aegis of No. 81 Wing, under Air Combat Group.[49][50] While the duration of the conversion courses has remained unchanged since the Hornets were introduced into service, the content covered has been altered over time to reflect upgrades to the Hornets, the replacement of the Macchis with superior BAE Hawk 127 trainers in the early 2000s, and experience gained from using Hornets in combat during the Iraq War.[4] No. 2 OCU conducted its 32nd fighter combat instructor course in 2013. The graduation exercise, Aces North, was the first to involve RAAF F/A-18 Super Hornets, Airbus KC-30 tankers, and Boeing E-7 Wedgetail early warning aircraft, as well as the 'Classic' Hornets.[51]

Lanny King McDonald (born February 16, 1953) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Colorado Rockies and Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL). He played over 1,100 games during a 16-year career in which he scored 500 goals and over 1,000 points. His total of 66 goals in 1982–83 remains the Flames' franchise record.
McDonald was selected by the Maple Leafs as the fourth overall pick in the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft and established himself as an offensive forward with three consecutive 40-goal seasons in Toronto in the mid-1970s. His trade to the Rockies in 1979 resulted in Toronto fans protesting the deal in front of Maple Leaf Gardens. He played parts of three seasons in Denver before he was sent to Calgary in 1981 where he spent the remainder of his career. He captained the Flames to a Stanley Cup championship in his final season of 1988–89.
He is among the most popular players in Flames history and his personality and bushy red moustache made him an iconic figure within the sport. McDonald won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and sportsmanship in 1983 and in 1988 was named the inaugural winner of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for his leadership and humanitarian presence, in particular through his long association with the Special Olympics. Internationally, he represented Team Canada as a player on two occasions and in a management role three times. He was a member of the inaugural Canada Cup championship team in 1976 and was director of player personnel of Canada's 2004 World Championship winning team. McDonald was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 1993. The Flames retired his uniform number 9 in 1990.

Early life[edit source | editbeta]

McDonald was born February 16, 1953, in Hanna, Alberta.[1] He is the youngest of four children after brother Lynn and sisters Donna and Dixie.[2] His father, Lorne, tended the family farm near the hamlet of Craigmyle, 35 kilometres (22 mi) outside Hanna.[3] The young Lanny viewed his father as his hero, often following Lorne around helping with whatever chores he could. McDonald credits his father for teaching him the value of honesty and hard work.[4] His mother, Phyllis, was a full-time teacher who was frequently involved with community events.[2]
Learning to skate at the age of five, McDonald immediately developed a passion for hockey. He served as a stick boy, helping manage equipment, for his father's community team and grew up listening to radio broadcasts of Hockey Night in Canada.[5] McDonald shared his father's passion for the Toronto Maple Leafs; he was given his middle name, King, after Maple Leafs' star King Clancy.[6] He began playing organized hockey at the age of six and, despite both having full-time commitments, his parents drove him and Lynn to Hanna for their practices and games. McDonald recalled that half of his time in youth hockey was spent in Hanna, and the other half in the car.[7] He completed high school while playing in Lethbridge, choosing to remain with his junior A team in 1970–71 rather than join the Medicine Hat Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) so that he could complete his diploma.[8]
Playing career[edit source | editbeta]

Junior[edit source | editbeta]
McDonald began his junior career in 1969 with the Lethbridge Sugar Kings of the tier II Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL). He appeared in 34 games for the Sugar Kings as a 16-year-old, scoring two goals. The following season, 1970–71, he emerged as a leading scorer, recording 37 goals and 82 points in 45 games.[9] He was voted the league's most valuable player and named to the Second All-Star team.[3][8] Additionally, McDonald appeared in six WCHL games with the Calgary Centennials.[9]
The Medicine Hat Tigers acquired McDonald's playing rights in a trade during the 1970–71 WCHL season.[8] He joined the team the following year, finishing eighth in league scoring with 114 points, including 50 goals.[10] He improved to 62 goals and 139 points in 1972–73 to finish third overall in league scoring and was named to the WCHL All-Star Team at forward.[3] McDonald added an additional 37 points in the playoffs as the Tigers won the league championship.[11]
In McDonald's draft year of 1973, the National Hockey League (NHL) was in competition with the rival World Hockey Association (WHA) for talent.[12] McDonald was considered a top junior prospect and was recruited by both leagues.[13] The Vancouver Canucks had the third overall selection in the NHL draft and were interested in drafting him, but opted against it when McDonald made it clear he would likely go to the WHA rather than play with Vancouver. Instead, he went to the Toronto Maple Leafs with the fourth overall pick.[13] In the WHA draft, he was selected 10th overall by the Cleveland Crusaders.[14] McDonald chose to play in the NHL, signing a contract with the Maple Leafs that was considered to be among the richest in the league. The deal, worth between $175,000 and $200,000 per season,[13] came as a result of the competition between the two leagues and McDonald found that some of the older players in Toronto resented him as a result.[12]
Toronto Maple Leafs[edit source | editbeta]
McDonald made his NHL debut with the Leafs on October 10, 1973, against the Buffalo Sabres. He assisted on two goals in the game, but also suffered a concussion and required several stitches after landing on his head as a result of a check by Rick Martin. Following the custom of most NHL players at the time, he played the game without wearing a helmet. It was the only time in his career he did so, as he felt that his injury contributed to his early struggles in the NHL.[15] McDonald scored his first NHL goal on October 17 against Michel Larocque of the Montreal Canadiens,[16] but finished the season with only 14 goals and 30 points in 1973–74.[9] His continued inability to score early in the 1974–75 season nearly resulted in a trade. Atlanta Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher sought to take advantage of the Maple Leafs' early disappointment in McDonald and agreed in principle to a trade for the young forward in exchange for Curt Bennett.[17] However, McDonald scored three goals in his following two games causing Toronto to back out of the deal.[18] McDonald recorded a modest improvement over his rookie campaign: 17 goals and 44 points.[9]
"Playing for my country in '76 was a tremendous honour. I got a phone call from someone claiming to be Alan Eagleson asking me if I wanted to try out for Team Canada in preparation for the first Canada Cup in 1976. At first, I thought it was Darryl (Sittler) playing a practical joke on me. It took Eagle some convincing before I realized I really was being invited to Team Canada's training camp."
—McDonald describes how he reacted to earning an invitation to try out for the national team at the 1976 Canada Cup.[19]
The patience the Maple Leafs had shown McDonald in his first two seasons was rewarded in 1975–76 when he rediscovered his offensive touch, scoring 37 goals and adding 56 assists.[6] Following the season, he earned an invite to the Canadian national team's summer camp in advance of the 1976 Canada Cup.[20] McDonald was named to the roster, and appeared in five of Team Canada's seven games. He recorded two assists in the tournament, one of which came on Darryl Sittler's overtime goal that clinched the inaugural Canada Cup championship.[19]
A 43-goal season in 1976–77 earned McDonald several accolades. He was named to the Wales Conference team at the 1977 All-Star Game where he scored two goals in a 4–3 victory over the Campbell Conference. He was also named a Second Team All-Star at right wing following the season.[21] It was the first of three consecutive 40-goal seasons for McDonald,[9] and he finished in the top ten in NHL scoring in both 1977–78 and 1978–79.[6] He appeared in his second All-Star Game in 1978 and played for the NHL All-Stars in the 1979 Challenge Cup against the Soviet national team.[3]
The highlight of McDonald's career in Toronto came in the 1978 Stanley Cup playoffs against the New York Islanders. The Maple Leafs were viewed as underdogs in the series against an Islanders team that was considered to be among the best in the league. Toronto overcame a 2–0 series deficit to force a seventh and deciding game. Playing despite breaking both his wrist and nose during the series,[22] McDonald scored the overtime winning goal that eliminated the Islanders and allowed the Maple Leafs to advance to the league semi-finals for the first time in 11 years.[23] Toronto was then eliminated by Montreal, who swept the series with four consecutive victories.[24]
Colorado Rockies[edit source | editbeta]
Punch Imlach was named Toronto general manager prior to the 1979–80 season and immediately clashed with team captain Darryl Sittler.[25] Imlach wanted to move Sittler to another team, but the player refused to waive his no trade clause. Imlach responded by trading teammates friendly to Sittler instead.[6] On December 28, 1979, Imlach dealt McDonald to the Colorado Rockies, along with Joel Quenneville, in exchange for Wilf Paiement and Pat Hickey. The deal came as a surprise even to Toronto's head coach.[26]
McDonald was devastated by the trade, particularly because he and his wife were expecting their second child and had just purchased a new house. In his 1987 autobiography, he argued that Imlach made the trade out of spite.[25] McDonald had also come into conflict with Imlach while serving as the team's representative of the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) when the general manager refused to honour an increase in the per diem paid to each player.[27] The trade outraged fans in Toronto, where McDonald was among the team's most popular players. While fans picketed outside Maple Leaf Gardens in protest, McDonald told the media that he felt fortunate to have been traded away from the unsettled situation the Leafs were in and blamed Imlach for the team's failures on the ice.[28] Sittler resigned as the team's captain following the trade.[29]
Arriving in Colorado, McDonald found himself at the centre of another power struggle. Sympathetic to the fact that his wife was less than two weeks away from giving birth, head coach Don Cherry gave McDonald permission to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season.[30] On the ice, McDonald scored 35 goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.[9]
Rumours circulated following the season that Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard had told the media that he was attempting to reacquire McDonald.[31] The Rockies disputed that any such negotiations had taken place and Ballard quickly apologized for the news story after Colorado threatened to file tampering charges against the Maple Leafs' owner.[32] McDonald served as the Rockies' captain, and scored 35 goals and 81 points in 1980–81, his only full season with the team.[6]
Calgary Flames[edit source | editbeta]
Stating that his team needed to add character and leadership, Cliff Fletcher finally completed a trade for McDonald seven years after his first attempt. McDonald was acquired by the Calgary Flames, along with a draft pick, in exchange for Bob MacMillan and Don Lever on November 25, 1981.[33] The deal occurred one day after the last place Rockies lost to the Flames by a 9–2 score.[34] Once the team's plane landed in Winnipeg, McDonald was informed of the trade and told to return to Calgary.[35] Angered at first, he viewed the deal as an insult, that the worst team in the NHL had rejected him.[36]
McDonald also felt the pressure of having to replace two popular ex-Flames in MacMillan and Lever while also working to overcome a separated shoulder he suffered earlier in the year with the Rockies.[37] He made his debut with the Flames the following night, a 7–1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, after which McDonald remarked that it was the most fun he had playing the game in a long time.[38] He was given a loud ovation by the fans who immediately embraced him as a local hero,[39] even though it took him seven games before he scored his first goal as a member of the Flames.[40] He scored 34 goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.[9]

The 1982–83 season was dominated by McDonald's battle with Wayne Gretzky of the Edmonton Oilers for the league lead in goals.[41] Amidst the best offensive season of his career, McDonald scored a hat trick against Pittsburgh to give him 47 goals at the mid-season break for the 1983 All-Star Game, a total that tied his career high.[42] He was named to the starting lineup for the All-Star Game and was the league's leading goal scorer at that point, two ahead of Gretzky.[43] McDonald finished with 66 goals, five short of Gretzky's 71. At that time, only Gretzky, Mike Bossy and Phil Esposito had ever scored more goals in one NHL season.[44] McDonald was named to the Second All-Star Team for the second time in his career and was voted the winner of the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, given to the player who "best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey".[45] His 66 goals remains a Flames' single season record.[46]
Following the trade of Phil Russell in the summer of 1983, McDonald and Doug Risebrough were named co-captains for the 1983–84 season.[47] They were joined by Jim Peplinski the following season. McDonald missed 15 games due to injuries which reduced his scoring to 33 goals and 66 points, but he played in his fourth All-Star Game.[48] He scored the first Flames goal in the Olympic Saddledome, on the building's opening night of October 15, 1983.[49]
McDonald became the 21st player in NHL history to score 400 career goals, reaching the mark in a 7–4 loss in Los Angeles on December 21, 1983.[50] He was initially credited with scoring the milestone goal in his previous game, against the Winnipeg Jets, but after reviewing a replay of the goal himself, McDonald asked the league to credit it to teammate Eddy Beers who had deflected his shot.[51] His injury problems worsened in 1984–85 as he missed the start of the season with pulled muscles and was limited to just 43 games.[9][52]
As the 1985–86 season approached, McDonald endured questions about whether he was reaching the point where age and injuries meant he could no longer be an effective NHL player.[53] Hoping to prove himself, he set a goal of playing all 80 games for the Flames.[54] He succeeded, and scored 28 goals and 71 points in the process,[9] despite dislocating his thumb in the pre-season and suffering minor knee and hip injuries during the course of the year. He later said it was a matter of pride to him not to miss a game.[17] In the playoffs, McDonald was witness to one of the most infamous mistakes in NHL history.[55][56][57] With the score tied at two in the seventh game of the Smythe Division final against Edmonton, McDonald chased Oilers' rookie Steve Smith around the Edmonton net. Smith attempted to pass the puck forward, but inadvertently hit the back of goaltender Grant Fuhr's skate, deflecting the puck into his own net.[58]
It turned out to be the winning goal for Calgary who eliminated Edmonton to clinch the Smythe Division championship.[59] The victory over their provincial rivals also touched off a celebration amongst the fans, of which over 20,000 greeted the team with wild cheering when their plane landed at Calgary International Airport.[60] A series win over the St. Louis Blues led McDonald and the Flames into their first Stanley Cup Final, against Montreal. The series ended in disappointment: He watched from the bench as his teammates unsuccessfully attempted to tie the deciding game in the final minute and the Canadiens defeated the Flames in five games to win the Stanley Cup.[61]
Two separate knee injuries limited McDonald in 1986–87.[62] His total of 14 goals in 58 games was his fewest since his rookie season.[9] He reached a milestone in the Flames' final game of the season, appearing in the 1,000th game of his career.[62] Following a 10-goal campaign in 60 games in 1987–88,[21] McDonald reached two additional major milestones in the 1988–89 season. On March 7, 1989, he scored the 1,000th point of his career in a 9–5 victory against the Winnipeg Jets.[21] Two weeks later, on March 21, he scored the 500th goal of his career on a wraparound from behind the net against Mark Fitzpatrick of the New York Islanders.[63] It was the final regular season goal of McDonald's career.[64]
"This is the most peaceful feeling I've ever experienced in hockey. There's no feeling like it. I wish I could describe it to people outside. I think you appreciate it a lot more after you've been trying to win it for 16 years, like I have."
—McDonald shares his emotions after winning the Stanley Cup[65]
At 36 years old and approaching the end of his career, the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs was potentially his last chance at winning the Stanley Cup.[66] The Flames defeated the Vancouver Canucks, Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks to set up a Stanley Cup final rematch with the Montreal Canadiens.[67] McDonald was left out of the Flames' lineup for the third, fourth and fifth games, but with Calgary leading the series three wins to two, head coach Terry Crisp felt that if the Flames were to win the championship, McDonald deserved to be in the game.[66] Crisp's decision paid dividends, as midway through the sixth game, McDonald stepped onto the ice after serving a penalty to join Håkan Loob and Joe Nieuwendyk in a three-on-one rush toward the Montreal goal. Loob passed the puck up to Nieuwendyk, who saw a streaking McDonald coming up the right side of the ice. McDonald received the pass then shot the puck over Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy's glove to give the Flames a 2–1 lead.[66] Doug Gilmour added two goals, and Calgary won the game 4–2 to earn the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship.[68] League president John Ziegler presented the trophy to McDonald, co-captain Jim Peplinski and alternate Tim Hunter. Wearing the captain's "C" for the game, McDonald was the first member of the Flames to carry the trophy as the team paraded it around the Forum in celebration.[66]
Management career[edit source | editbeta]

McDonald announced his retirement as a player on August 28, 1989, stating in a press conference that he made the determination before the 1988–89 season began that it would be his last.[1] He also revealed that he had received an offer from another, unnamed, team to play in 1989–90 but felt that it was the right time to end his career.[69] The Flames made McDonald their Vice President in Charge of Corporate and Community Affairs.[1] He chose the corporate position partly due to a fascination with the business world, and partly to remain close to his family as a role in hockey operations would have necessitated more travel.[70] His interest in business grew following his trade to Calgary as he was featured in numerous commercials and signed endorsements throughout southern Alberta.[71] He had also previously served as a vice president of the NHLPA in the early 1980s.[72] McDonald changed roles in 1992 as he was named the team's Vice President of Marketing.[73] After serving four years in that position, McDonald became the Vice President of Corporate Development in 1996.[74]
McDonald was part of a committee tasked with hiring a new management team in June 2000. The media speculated that after several years in a corporate position, he hoped to land a role as a vice president within hockey operations.[75] He received no such role, and two months after the hiring of Craig Button as executive vice president and general manager of the Flames, McDonald announced he was leaving the organization. McDonald denied claims from team sources that he was upset at not gaining a new role when Button was hired. He stated that after "nineteen great years here in one organization", it was the right time to retire.[76] He retained a small role in the organization, serving as a board member of the Saddledome Foundation.[77]
Ken King, newly hired president of the Flames, lured McDonald back into the organization a year later by naming him an executive assistant to hockey operations.[78] McDonald held the position until 2003.[79] He also served in hockey operations roles with Hockey Canada. McDonald was the general manager of Team Canada for the 2001 and 2002 World Championships. He returned in 2004 in a role as director of player personnel of Canada's gold medal-winning squad.[80][81]

McDonald was the first player in Flames history to have his number retired by the team.
McDonald was known primarily as an offensive player with a hard shot.[3] His wrist shot was considered to be effective,[82] and his scoring exploits in junior hockey earned him the nickname "Machine-Gun Lanny".[16] Red Kelly, McDonald's coach in his first NHL seasons, recalled that he was impressed with his young player's skill handling the puck and defended McDonald against critics who wanted him moved out of Toronto due to his early struggles.[83] In his NHL career, McDonald led his team in goal scoring six times: 1976–77, 1977–78 and 1978–79 with Toronto,[84] 1980–81 with Colorado,[85] and 1981–82 and 1982–83 in Calgary.[86] He was also a physical player, willing to play a hard-hitting style in the corners.[3]
As age and injuries took their toll, McDonald's role with the Flames changed. His playing time decreased in his later years as he was no longer counted on to be the team's primary offensive threat.[87] Often left out of the lineup in his final season, McDonald was expected to provide a boost to the team when he drew into the lineup.[88] He was counted on to provide a veteran presence and to act as a mentor for the team's younger players.[63]
Legacy[edit source | editbeta]

The Flames arrived in Calgary after relocating from Atlanta for the 1980–81 season. The organization entered a transitional phase, as many players used to the warm weather and relaxed atmosphere of Atlanta were unable or unwilling to adapt to the higher expectations fans in Calgary placed on them. David Poile, then Flames assistant general manager, stated that the team had an identity crisis as a result.[89] It was in this atmosphere that General Manager Cliff Fletcher made the trade for McDonald on November 25, 1981, claiming that McDonald added two characteristics the Flames lacked: character and leadership.[33]
McDonald's arrival in Calgary was considered a turning point for the organization, one where his personality, demeanor and on-ice play came to define the Flames in the 1980s.[90] Poile argued that it signaled the true beginning of the team in its new market: "The trade for Lanny McDonald was the start of the Calgary Flames franchise. It gave us that Calgary identity, that Western Canadian flavor."[89] Columnist and co-author of McDonald's autobiography, Steve Simmons, agreed. He added that the personal and professional disappointments McDonald endured in Toronto and Colorado resulted in his gaining a greater appreciation of both the game and himself.[90] McDonald was extremely popular with his teammates and the fans wherever he played,[91] as well as with the media – he was named Colorado's athlete of the year in 1980 by the state's sportswriters.[82]
Renowned for his leadership ability, McDonald cultivated the respect of the team's younger players. He came into the NHL at a time when the battle with the rival WHA for talent led to rookies signing for far more money than the previous generation of players commanded. Consequently, McDonald faced the resentment of several of Toronto's veteran players and resolved to show greater respect to those that followed him.[92] His efforts left a lasting impression on his peers;[93] among them was Tiger Williams who called McDonald "a great ambassador" for the NHL.[94]
The Flames made McDonald the first player in franchise history to have his jersey retired when they raised his number 9 to the rafters of the Olympic Saddledome in a ceremony on March 17, 1990.[95] As part of its 1992 class, he was also the first former Flame to gain induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame.[96] One year later he was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame.[97] McDonald's image endured well into retirement; in 2008, he was the only athlete named in a list of Alberta's ten greatest citizens compiled by the Calgary Herald.[35][98]
Personal life[edit source | editbeta]

McDonald met his wife Ardell while playing junior hockey for the Medicine Hat Tigers.[99] They were married in 1975,[100] and have four children: daughters Andra and Leah, and sons Barrett and Graham.[101] The family settled in Calgary after McDonald's trade to the Flames. They also maintain a summer home in Montana,[102] where the family has invested in restaurants and a craft brewery in the community of Lakeside. Co-owned by Andra, the brewery considers McDonald its inspiration, and produces "Old 'Stache Porter" in his honour.[103][104]
His giant, walrus-style moustache is McDonald's most defining physical characteristic and helped him become an iconic figure in the sport.[21] He developed it in 1974, spending the summer seeing what kind of beard he could grow. Knowing that the Maple Leafs did not allow players to maintain beards at the time, he settled on what he described as a "normal moustache" once he returned to Toronto. Some time later, he was inspired by baseball player Sparky Lyle's moustache and chose to grow one in a similar style.[105] It became a symbol for the Flames as some fans took to wearing fake red moustaches during playoff runs.[106] Razor manufacturers offered endorsements if he would shave it, which he refused.[107]
"Lanny brings with him a high profile for the Special Olympics. He's helped us develop sponsors. He attends all our major events. He works with the athletes, communicating with them as if they were his equal, and they are. They just love him."
—Al Brolin, president of Canadian Special Olympics in 1987[108]
Among his charitable and humanitarian efforts, McDonald is best known for his participation with the Special Olympics.[35] He first became involved with the organization in 1974 when the Maple Leafs asked him to represent the team at the Special Olympics Summer Games.[109] The event began a decades long association for McDonald.[110] He was the honourary coach of the 1986 Special Olympics Summer Games in Calgary,[111] and served as a head coach for the Canadian Special Olympics floor hockey team. In 1988, McDonald's contributions to the Special Olympics as a coach and co-chairman of the organization's fundraising efforts, as well as his work with the Alberta Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, were recognized by the NHL as he was named the inaugural recipient of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy. The award is given to the hockey player who best exemplifies leadership on the ice with humanitarian contributions off of it.[112] McDonald was previously honoured by the Flames as the first winner of the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in 1987, which he won again in 1989.[113]
McDonald's autobiography, Lanny, co-written by Steve Simmons, was published in 1987. A Canadian best-seller, it was an unexpected success for publisher McGraw-Hill.[114] The book sold 10,000 copies in its first couple months of publication, for which the publisher made a donation of $10,000 to the Special Olympics.[108] In 2008, McDonald was given an honourary doctorate from the University of Calgary.[115]
