Pronounceable Password Generator
================================

-----------------------------

What does it do?
----------------

This handy tool generates passwords that are memorable since they are pronouncable. The password lengths and pronouncability is customizable and the passwords generated are as random as the pseudo random number generator that the system uses in producing them.

How does it do what it does?
----------------------------

By storing frequencies of common letter sequences, it is possible for a machine to get a rudimentary grasp of what pronouncable means and how to make things pronouncable.

Further possibilities for improvement
-------------------------------------

+ Keep a feedback mechanism to weed out the unpronouncable words it produces every now and then.
+ Keep a larger database of frequencies to dip into to increase the pronouncability even more.
+ Keep track of frequency evolution with start and end of words. For example, some letters are more common at the start of a word than at its end.
